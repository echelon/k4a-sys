k4a-sys
-------
A Bingden Wrapper for the Azure Kinect Sensor SDK.

Linux only at this instant but I'll add Windows support soon.

Dependencies
-------
You need `libk4a` installed, for example by running

```
apt install k4a-dev
```

It might be possible to compile libk4a from source in the future,
but it looks time consuming at the moment.
